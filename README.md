# Ascent

A **Descent**-inspired 3D game where you control a spacecraft in an hostile space station.

Created using a custom OpenGL engine, that you can find [here](https://github.com/Oreyato/SimpleOpenGLEngine). This is a slightly modified version of **Gaetz**'s engine. You can take a look at his right [here](https://github.com/Gaetz/opengl-training/tree/master/SimpleEngineWithOpenGL/SimpleEngineWithOpenGL-030).
